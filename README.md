# Scraper usage
Clone or download the repo from github

To run the scraper:
1. Open a shell
1. `cd` to the directory containing the script
1. Run the script by typing `./AHA-Scraper-Linux.sh`

The resulting `BinaryAnalysis.csv` can either be viewed in a text/spreadsheets app (such as Excel) or visualized in the [AHA-GUI](https://github.com/aha-project/AHA-GUI).

Note: If the script is not executable you can fix that by running `chmod +x ./AHA-Scraper-Linux.sh`
